# Vue Typescript Base

Vue Typescript Base is a base project for Vue and TypeScript that is made to marry [aspnetboilerplate](https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate) with Vue.
While aspnetboilerplate was the main reason to create the project, the base project can easily be updated to work with any API.
